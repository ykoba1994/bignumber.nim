# bignumber.nim

An implementation of arbitrary precision integers and floating point numbers for Nim.

## Features

- BigInt and BigFloat type in base 1E16
- Depends on Nim standard libraries only (algorithm, math, sequtils and strutils)
- Moderately fast: One million digits of Pi can be calculated within reasonable times (20 seconds to a few minutes)
- Operators for comparison, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are overloaded

## Important Notice

- FFT multiplication is not implemented, so this library is not suitable for extremely large digits
- High memory consumption (caluculating one million digits of Pi with Chudnovsky series requires about 70MB)
- Base conversion is not supported
- Bitwise operations are not supported
- Parallelization is not supported
- Development in pre-alpha stage. Not intended to practical purposes
