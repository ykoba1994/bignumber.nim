# bignumber.nim

An implementation of arbitrary precision integers and floating point numbers for Nim.

## Description

This library provides BigInt and BigFloat type in base 1E16. BigInts and BigFloats are signed. 

This library uses Nim standard libraries only (algorithm, math, sequtils and strutils).

Multiplication in this library is moderately fast because Karatsuba and Toom-Cook 3, 4 and 6.5 algorithms are implemented. One million digits of Pi can be calculated within reasonable times (Most computers calculate it within 30 seconds).


## Implemented Features

BigInt type supports the following operations.

- Constructing BigInt objects from strings or integers.
- Converting BigInt objects to strings.
- Basic arithmetic operations (>, >=, ==, <=, <, +, +=, -, -=, *, *=, div, mod, divmod, ^).
- Iterators (.., ..<, countup, countdown).

BigFloat type supports the following operations.

- Constructing BigFloat objects from strings, integers or BigInts.
- Converting BigFloat objects to strings.
- Setting precision for calculation.
- Getting current precision.
- Basic arithmetic operations (>, >=, ==, <=, <, +, +=, -, -=, *, *=, ^).
- Square root.

## What's not yet implemented

At present, this library supports very basic operations only. The following features are not implemented.

- FFT multiplication
- Base conversion
- Bitwise operations
- Mathematical functions except square root
- Parallelization


## TODO

- Implement above features
- Write tests
- Release as a nimble package when this library becomes stable 


## Important Notice

This library requires much memory (calculating one million digits of Pi with Chudnovsky series requires 35-70MB).

Development of this library is in pre-alpha stage. This library is not intended to practical purposes.

The source file in "src" directory supports only Nim-1.6 or later. For older version, use the file in "deprecated" directory.
